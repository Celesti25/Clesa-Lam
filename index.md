Today may not be the most pleasurable but it is the most fulfilling in terms of the leaps I've taken with a learning ability of a mice chasing around dodging cheese traps. I can say I've improved a whole lot. Although I was initially afraid of doing things wrong, I believe I learnt a huge lot from watch others and following the process taught by my teacher. It's hard to tune out the attitudes designed for failure and feeling you've got it right when you really don't have that much of a clue - just coasting in the midst, pretending you've got it all together...
