Today may not be the most pleasurable but it is the most fulfilling in terms of the leaps I've taken with a learning ability of a mice chasing around dodging cheese traps. I've improved a whole lot but I need to refine my mindset and ability to still the mind. Despite initially starting wrong, I believe and know I still have the ability to correct it and make amends. I learnt a whole lot from watching others and following the process taught by my teacher. It's hard to tune out the inner bitchy voice designed to lull you into believing you'd inevitably fail no matter how much you believe you're prepared. There's always that feeling when you think you can do it but you're really just coasting in the midst, pretending you've got it all together but practice breeds self confidence and the promises you keep to yourself in the long run builds innate trust and starves most worries and doubts...
